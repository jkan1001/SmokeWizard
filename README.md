# SmokeWizard
## Autonomous smoker capstone project (TAMU 2025)

This is the codebase for the Smoke Wizard capstone project in (TAMU Spring-Fall 2025, MXET/ESET). The ESP32 automatically controls a meat smoker for smoking brisket. It is responsible for recording measured sensor data, hosting a webpage for remote monitoring and control, and implementing stable feedback control for smoker chamber temperature. 
The ESP-32 saves network credentials for a local Wi-Fi network. Upon restart, it attempts to connect to a network using the saved credentials. If it doesn't work, it creates its own LAN in Access-Point (AP) mode and hosts a webpage where the user can provide the SSID and password of another local Wi-Fi network. Once the network setup is successful, the ESP-32 hosts another HTML webpage in Access-Point/Station mode (AP/STA). The user then has the option to connect to the ESP32 as an access point or as a station (over the separate local Wi-Fi network). The main webpage allows the user to control the internal temperature of the smoker, frequency of spritzing, and total duration of smoking. It also provides the user with real-time monitoring of all available information on the status of the smoker, including the measured internal temperature profile of the brisket, remaining fluid levels, fuel consumption rate, and remaining level of fuel pellets.
